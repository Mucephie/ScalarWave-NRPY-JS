# ScalarWave-NRPY-JS
## ScalarWave code from Numerical Relativity in Python and beyond (NRPY+) to JavaScript
ScalarWave-NRPY-JS is a JavaScript port of [https://github.com/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/blob/master/Tutorial-Start_to_Finish-ScalarWave.ipynb] . This is an early test of bringing numerical relativity to the browser environment using JavaScript and webAssembly generated by Emscripten [https://emscripten.org/index.html] utilizing modified NRPY+ generated C scripts.

### A browser based ScalarWave in 3-D
Initially, NRPY+ computes a ScalarWave in 3-D over a set ammount of timesteps and then compares to an exact solution to verify the validity of the efficient NRPY+ code. This project breaks the simulation framework into a global setting that is callable piece by piece so that it can be continuously called when compiled into javascript and take input from the user between timesteps.
